# Scientific article template

This repository is used as a template to start a new scientific
article. Currently it's more or less configured for the IWA journals, in
particular the Journal of Water and Health. 

After writing *manuscript.md*, *tables.md*, and *figures.md*, running 

``` bash
./knit.sh
```

will convert the documents to odt format, which should then be saved to docx
from within LibreOffice. I'm hoping to improve on this later, and make it more
general.
